Welcome to Branland! I'm Bran, and this is my personal website. I'm a Software Engineer living in Portland. My interests include mathematics, computer science, and information security. I'm also into board games, video games, tabletop role-playing games, coffee, wine, and whiskey. I'm new to Portland, so I'm looking for fun stuff to do.

I used to live in the Bay Area. I don't think I'll ever want to go back, but it was fun while it lasted. If you get the chance to visit, make sure to see Santa Cruz (especially the boardwalk!) and Carmel-by-the-Sea.

## Subpages

*  [AC:NH Flower Breeding Tool](/flowers): a tool for exploring the genetic results of breeding flowers in the game *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. For more information, check out a flower breeding guideâ€”I like [Satogu's guide](https://aiterusawato.github.io/satogu/acnh/) for an easy introduction and [Paleh's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs) for more advanced information (and a descripton of the genotype notation used by this tool).

## Projects

I do a lot of hobby programming. Most of it isn't that useful, but it is fun. Most of my coding these days is done in [Go](https://golang.org/) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), both of which are pretty great languages. I'm also proficient in Java, Python, and a number of other languages.

Here are some of my favorite projects:

*  [This site](https://github.com/BranLwyd/www): the server for this site is a custom-written pure-Go webserver. It supports HTTP/2 via Go's standard library, and uses the [acme/autocert](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/acme/autocert) package to automatically retrieve and renew TLS certificates. The server is built using [Bazel](https://bazel.build/). The site's static content (HTML/CSS/etc) is stored as files in the webserver's repository; during compilation, these files are compiled into Go code and embedded into the server binary via Bazel's `go_embed_data` rule. This means that a single command is all that is needed to compile all of the various sources (code and static assets) into a static binary. Updates to the site only require replacing the old binary with a new binary and restarting the service. Everything is served from memory: the filesystem is used only to cache TLS certificates. The server is configured to only use modern cipher suites and to require TLS 1.3, and it receives an A+ on the [Qualys SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). This configuration does mean that only modern browsers are supported, however.
*  [redird](https://github.com/BranLwyd/redird): a simple configuration-based link shortener/redirector, written in Go. Also has the ability to generate indexes, which allows it to act as a link aggregator; the indexes can optionally display images in the case that the linked content is an image. This code powers my link aggregator, [bran.to](https://bran.to/).
*  [acnh\_flowers](https://github.com/BranLwyd/acnh_flowers): a library allowing for exploration of flower genetics in the game *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*, written in Go. It includes functionality allowing the parsing and rendering of genotypes, breeding genotypes or distributions on genotypes together, and searching for efficient breeding paths. It powers the Flower Breeding Tool linked above.
*  [rspd](https://github.com/BranLwyd/rspd): a simple TLS SNI proxy, written in Rust. This daemon parses enough of the TLS ClientHello message to determine the hostname indicated in the SNI extension, and then proxies the connection to a host based on that SNI hostname.
*  [rgdcd](https://github.com/BranLwyd/rgdcd): a simple Google Domains Dynamic DNS client, written in Rust. This daemon wakes up once per minute, checks its public IP address, and updates a Google Domains Dynamic DNS entry using the [Google Domains API](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083) whenever the IP changes.
*  [rssdl](https://github.com/BranLwyd/rssdl): a pure-Go daemon which watches a set of RSS feeds and downloads any new files (represented as links in the RSS feed) to a specified directory. When the feed is checked, and how frequently, can be configured on a per-feed basis. Uses [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) as a build system.
*  [bNotify](https://github.com/BranLwyd/bNotify): a pure-Go daemon & Android app which allows you to push notifications to your phone from any computer. It uses [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) to push the notifications. The notification data is encrypted & authenticated in transit. However, this is just a toy project, so you probably shouldn't trust it; at the very least, every server uses the same key so compromise of one server leads to compromise of the authenticity/confidentiality of messages from all servers. It does retry nicely, however. It's good for sending best-effort notifications for events from your various servers.
*  [tumblr-sync](https://github.com/BranLwyd/tumblr-sync): a Java library which provides access to various Tumblr objects as native Java objects, and allows those objects to be persisted locally.
*  [bdcpu16](https://github.com/BranLwyd/bdcpu16): a Java implementation of the [DCPU-16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatesphere/demi-16/master/docs/dcpu-specs/dcpu-1-7.txt) virtual machine from Notch's cancelled 0x10c. Includes support for all hardware defined by the specification, an assembler, and a debugger.
